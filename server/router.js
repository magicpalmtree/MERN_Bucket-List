// Import stuff:

// Add the Passport interceptor/middleware that'll live btwn the incoming request & router:
var requireAuth = passport.authenticate('jwt', {session: false});
// By default, the .authenticate above wants to make a cookie. Since we're using jwt, we don't WANT a cookie. That's why we set the 1st parameter to 'jwt' and the 2nd to {session: false}.

var requireSignin = passport.authenticate('local', {session:false});
